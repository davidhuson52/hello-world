# hello-world
Testing out github workflow

The new workflow will be as follows:
The overall flow of Gitflow is:

A develop branch is created from master
A release branch is created from develop
Feature branches are created from develop
When a feature is complete it is merged into the develop branch
When the release branch is done it is merged into develop and master
If an issue in master is detected a hotfix branch is created from master
Once the hotfix is complete it is merged to both develop and master
